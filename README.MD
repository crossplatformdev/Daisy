<b>Javascript Engine</b>

Daisy have a built in Javascript engine that you could access by preceding a message with double slash (//). 

You can use it to perform simple math using Javascript or even track character sheets in user defined objects!
There are wrappers for standard roll commands as //d(ammount), //w(ammount), //r(ammount).

Dicey have another functionalities not yet documented as they're still under develompent. I encourage you to check the code and discover them!.
